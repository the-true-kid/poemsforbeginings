A poem about beginings 

soft sounds

before and after 

i hear soft sounds 

i feel soft sounds 

lightly whispering in my ear 

a hello and a goodbye

one sound

a song

so good to hear your voice again darling 

hearing your footsteps..

just walk right in

make yourself at home 

and dont feel bad, when it's time to leave

we all knew it was going to change , grow , anyways ..
